<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>The original Avatar was so successful because of the novelty of hyperrealism in the late 2000s, which was just developing as an art form.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The film has a sense of grandeur that most other Marvel films try to replicate but fail at it almost every time.</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>The performances, cinematography, and still impressive effects are hard not to love.</p>
